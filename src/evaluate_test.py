"""Part 4 -- spend the TEST set once, on the frozen design.

There are no ground-truth labels (DBSCAN invented the classes), so the
honest question the test set can answer is: does the cheap shipped model
(the uint8 grid lookup) reproduce the decision of the expensive research
artifact (the continuous KDE) on data it never saw? Agreement is the
accuracy figure; the confusion view shows where the two disagree.

Frozen inputs: bandwidth h and grid come from validation; the byte tables
come from surfaces.npz (training data only). Reusing test data to tune any
of these would invalidate the number below.
